                        <p>
                            Sawyer Nursery, Inc. of Hudsonville, Michigan has been in the perennial business for over 60
                            years. We are now an industry-leading producer of a wide variety of perennials in many
                            different sizes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bob and Shirley Sawyer founded Sawyer Nursery in 1956 as a way to raise extra income to
                            support a growing family. In the
                            early years, Shirley supervised crews during the day doing such tasks as weeding,
                            cultivating, and irrigating the plants while
                            Bob worked as a bricklayer and as a truck driver. Ten years later, the nursery became the
                            sole source of income for the Sawyer
                            family.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When Bob and Shirley started out, they grew container plants for local markets, plant
                            brokers, and larger nurseries in the area.
                            They later added bareroot material for mail order customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 1974 the Sawyer family purchased 90 acres in which the main portion of the nursery is now
                            located. Acreage has been
                            added through the years, and the nursery now operates on approximately 300 acres in two
                            states. Through the ensuing years,
                            the nursery has broadened its variety of offerings and added many more product lines. The
                            container line now includes hundreds of individual varieties in dozens of container types
                            and sizes. Popular containers include 3-inch, 4.5-inch, “1 Gallon”, and
                            “2 Gallon” pots. We continuously strive to provide the most attractive and high-value
                            products possible.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With many years of experience growing seedling and cutting plug varieties for their own use,
                            Sawyer Nursery was ready to
                            step in as a supplier when the popularity of plugs began to grow. Plugs are also offered in
                            a variety of tray sizes. We sell plugs
                            in 72-cell, 50-cell, and 21-cell flats, with the larger plug sizes growing rapidly in
                            popularity. We also offer vernalized
                            (cold-treated) material to increase first-year blooms.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the immense popularity and high demand for larger container and plug sizes, Sawyer
                            Nursery plans to continue growing
                            and expanding in these areas. We see the demand for perennials continuing to grow for many
                            years, with more emphasis on
                            new varieties, larger sizes, and high-quality material. Our market for container material
                            currently covers most of the Midwest
                            United States, with plugs and bareroot material shipped throughout the United States and
                            Canada
